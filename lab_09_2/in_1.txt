No doubt that learning languages takes up a lot of time.
That is why some people think that it would be better to
have only one language on our planet. But will it be
really beneficial for mankind?

In my opinion, the reduction of the number of languages
is a disaster because it will totally destroy our great
cultural heritage. With each loss of a language comes a
loss of a culture, a loss of a way of life that deserves
to be protected and treated as valuable. I also believe
that leaving one language for communication will greatly
reduce the linguistic diversity of our planet, which is
the key to our survival. What is more, it will be rather
difficult to choose which language to use and it may even
lead to wars.
