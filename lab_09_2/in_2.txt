There are a lot of zoos in the world and millions of
people visit them every year. But are zoos harmful or
helpful to animals which are caged there?

I strongly believe that we should not keep animals in
zoos because captivity is not natural for them and it
is a constant stress to a wild animal. Keeping animals
in zoos harms them by denying them freedom of movement
and association. What is more, zoos are like prisons
for animals as they live in small cages and do not get
necessary food. In addition, animals become very
aggressive and unpredictable as they get older and
often attack zoo keepers and other people.
