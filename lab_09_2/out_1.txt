No doubt that learning gnaluages takes up a lot of time.
That is why some people think that it would be better to
have only one gnaluage on our planet. But will it be
really beneficial for mankind?

In my opinion, the reduction of the number of gnaluages
is a disaster because it will totally destroy our great
cultural heritage. With each loss of a gnaluage comes a
loss of a culture, a loss of a way of life that deserves
to be protected and treated as valuable. I also believe
that leaving one gnaluage for communication will greatly
reduce the linguistic diversity of our planet, which is
the key to our survival. What is more, it will be rather
difficult to choose which gnaluage to use and it may even
lead to wars.
